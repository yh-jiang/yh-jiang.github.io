# About Me
Hi there! My name is **Yuhong Jiang(江禹宏)**, and I am currently a M.S. student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Before coming to L.A., I spent my 4 years of undergraduate study at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. My research interests include but are not limited to **machine learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning and other AI-related areas**.

# Research Experience
* **Phase Identification of Power Consumers in Power Distribution Network Based on Big Data, 2018.12 - 2019.06**  
_Supervised by [Prof. Jin Lin](http://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/cn/faculties/jlin/) at Tsinghua University_  
  - Applied Random Forest Classifier and Mapper of Topological Data Analysis(TDA) to the phase identification of smart meters, based on collected historical big data of voltage magnitude, and fine-tuned the model.  
  - Applied Monte Carlo method to the model, which helped select the training sets effectively and improve accuracy of phase identification with small workload.

_Supervised by [Prof. Xiaodong Wang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~wangx/) at Columbia University_  
  -	Simulated two blockchain systems: Bitcoin system and Ethereum system by Matlab.  
  - Analyzed the difference of behavior and security of the two systems when under attack.


# Relevant Course Projects
* **Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning, 2020.05 - 2020.06, UCLA**  
  - Implemented both DQN and Double DQN on a PLE game ‘Pixelcopter’.  
  - Optimized and compared the two networks. Evaluated their issues of value overestimation.  
  - The trained agent achieved humal-level performance.
  
* **Combined Network Based Deep Learning Methods for EEG Dataset Classification, 2020.03, UCLA**  
  - Implemented and combined different architectures of CNN and RNN, and optimized them over hyper parameters.  
  - Applied data augmentation, voting methods, etc. to the model, which boosted the accuracy to over 70%.
  
* **Grocery Shopping Helper Web Application Based on Interactively Customized Image Classifier, 2019.11 - 2019.12, UCLA**  
  - Implemented a customizable web application, which classified goods based on a MobileNet by Google.  
  - Applied transfer learning to the application by removing the last layer of MobileNet and appending KNN to it, enabling the model to be trained and customized simultaneously.
  
* **The Design of a Recognition Model of Grayscale Handwritten Numbers, 2019.05, Tsinghua University**  
  - Developed a recognition model of combined networks of five Lenet-5.  
  - Achieved the accuracy of over 99% by applying the model trained on 42,000 images of handwritten numbers to 28,000 new images.  
  
* **The Development of a Chinese Input Method, 2019.03, Tsinghua University**  
  - Developed a Chinese Input Model by Python, using Hidden Markov Model, Viterbi Algorithm, etc.  
  - Realized the output of corresponding Chinese characters of highest probability by identifying the input phonetic transcription of sentences.
