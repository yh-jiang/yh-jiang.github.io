## Research Experience
* **Phase Identification of Power Distribution Network Based on Big Data, 2018.12 - 2019.06**  
_Supervised by Prof. Jin Lin at Tsinghua University_  
  - Applied Random Forest Classifier and Mapper of Topological Data Analysis(TDA) to the phase identification of smart meters, based on collected historical big data of voltage magnitude, and fine-tuned the model.  
  - Applied Monte Carlo method to the model, which helped select the training sets effectively and improve accuracy of phase identification with small workload.
